- The present study explored treatment performance and nitrogen removal mechanisms of a novel tidal flow constructed wetland (TF CW) under C/N ratios ranging from two to 12. High and stable COD (83–95%), (63–80%), and TN (50–82%) removal efficiency were simultaneously achieved in our single-stage TF CW without costly aeration. 
- Results showed that a C/N ratio exceeding six was required to achieve complete denitrification without and accumulation in the system. Molecular biological analyses revealed aerobic ammonia oxidation was the dominant removal pathway when the C/N ratio was less than or equal to six. However, when the C/N ratio was greater than six, anammox was notably enhanced, resulting in another primary removal pathway, in addition to the aerobic ammonia oxidation. 
- Quantitative response relationships between nitrogen transformation rates and nitrogen functional genes were established, and these relationships confirmed that different nitrogen transformation processes were coupled at the molecular level (functional genes), and collaboratively contributed to nitrogen removal in the TF CW. Specifically,  transformation rates were collectively determined by amoA, nxrA, anammox, narG, nirS, nirK, and nosZ; and TN removal was influenced primarily by amoA and anammox.
